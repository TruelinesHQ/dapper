## Opening your first Pull Request

Working on your Pull Request? You can learn from this video series from Kent C Dodds.

[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

To help you get your first contribution and get familiar with our contribution process, check issues tagged as "good first issues". This label means that there is already a working solution to the issue in the discussion section. Therefore, it is a great place to get started.

You can also work on any other issue you choose to. The "good first" and "good to take" issues are just issues where we have a clear picture about scope and timeline. Pull requests working on other issues or completely new problems may take a bit longer to review when they don't fit into our current development cycle.

If you decide to fix an issue, please be sure to check the comment thread in case somebody is already working on a fix. If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you have started to work on it so other people don't accidentally duplicate your effort.

If somebody claims an issue but doesn't follow up for more than a week, it's fine to take it over but you should still leave a comment. If there has been no activity on the issue for 7 to 14 days, it is safe to assume that nobody is working on it.

## Commit style guide

Please read the [commit style guide ðŸ“•](https://github.com/TruelinesHQ/.github/blob/main/conventions/commit-style.md) to learn how we write commit titles.

## Sending a Pull Request

The is a community project, so Pull Requests are always welcome, but, before working on a large change, it is best to open an issue first to discuss it with the maintainers.

When in doubt, keep your Pull Requests small. To give a Pull Request the best chance of getting accepted, don't bundle more than one feature or bug fix per Pull Request. It's often best to create two smaller Pull Requests than one big one.

The core team will be monitoring for Pull Requests. We will review your Pull Request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanaion.
